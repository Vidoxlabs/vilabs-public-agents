# General Purpose Agents

General-purpose agents are suitable across many repositories and technology stacks.

## When to Use

- Initial repository onboarding
- Broad code quality and architecture assessments
- Exploratory tasks with unclear requirements
- Template-driven project setup

## Guidelines

- Keep instructions stack-flexible
- Prefer recommendation outputs over auto-mutation
- Document assumptions and confidence levels
- Include clear limits and fallback behavior

See `../docs/creating-agents.md` for creation standards.
