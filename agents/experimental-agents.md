# Experimental Agents

This directory contains agents that are under active development, testing, or exploration.

## ⚠️ Important

Agents in this directory are:

- **Not production-ready**
- **May change significantly**
- **Have lower confidence ratings**
- **Require additional validation**

## Purpose

The experimental directory serves as:

- Testing ground for new agent concepts
- Sandbox for trying new approaches
- Incubation space before promotion to stable agents

## Promotion Criteria

An experimental agent can be promoted to stable status within its domain (backend, core, data, devops, or web) when it meets:

1. Confidence rating ≥ 0.70
2. Success rate ≥ 80%
3. Usage count ≥ 50
4. Comprehensive documentation
5. Positive community feedback

Once promoted, move the agent from this directory to the appropriate domain folder in `agents/`.

## Contributing

We encourage experimentation! Feel free to:

- Add new experimental agents
- Test and provide feedback
- Suggest improvements
- Help refine capabilities
